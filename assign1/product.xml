		<p>Business and related subjects (such as the FAME group <span>&#8211;</span> finance, accounting, management and economics) are among the most popular fields of study at universities worldwide, particularly at graduate level. You might have some vague ideas about why this is the case <span>&#8211;</span> business graduates are in high demand worldwide, business touches on pretty much every aspect of modern human society, careers with a business degree are diverse and often highly paid <span>&#8211;</span> and these assumptions are likely to be largely true. Business graduates go on to work in myriad different sectors, and not all of them are those you would typically associate with business in general. More obvious careers with a business degree include roles in accounting and finance departments, which take in large numbers of business degree graduates. Other sectors with high demand for business graduates include marketing and advertising, as well as retail, sales, human resources and business consultancy. The diversity and plenitude of careers with a business degree underlies the subject<span>&#39;</span>s appeal for many students.</p>
